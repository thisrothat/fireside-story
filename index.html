    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>someone suggested the dinner down the road</p>
    <p>but it was so dark that I could barely see the road</p>
    <p>Cynthia suggested we go snowboarding</p>
    <p>I already said my knee hurts damnit!!! Netflix!</p>
    <p>but my knee was hurting, so I suggested netflix instead</p>
